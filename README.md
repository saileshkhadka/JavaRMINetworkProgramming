Sockets are bound to the port numbers and when we run any server it just listens on the socket and waits for client requests.
The socket is bound to a port number 1099 so that the TCP layer can identify the application data that is designed to be sent.


To test java socket programming of server-client communication, first we need to run SocketServer class. When you will run socket server, it will just print “Waiting for client request” and then wait for the client request.
