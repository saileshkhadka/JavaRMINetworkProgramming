Every server is a program that runs on a specific system and listens on a specific port. Sockets are bound to the port numbers and when we run any server it just listens on the socket and waits for client requests.
The socket is bound to a port number 1099 so that the TCP layer can identify the application data that is designed to be sent.


To test java socket programming of server-client communication, first we need to run SocketServer class. When you will run socket server, it will just print “Waiting for client request” and then wait for the client request.
